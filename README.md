# FutureForecastWeather

## Description

This application is developed as an app that travelers can use to easily search for and view weather data for any city in the world and upcoming 5-day forecast so that they may plan their travels accordingly. This browser-based application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as the OpenWeatherMap web API to take in user input of a city name, country code, and state code, and displays the current and future weather data (i.e., weather conditions, temperature, wind speed, and humidity) on the webpage for users to reference.

The application functions by fetching available, open-source data available through the OpenWeatherMap web API then creating and appending new HTML elements to display the weather data on the page using the DOM to dynamically present users with weather information relevant to their search parameters. The code also includes functions to save search history to local storage, render saved search buttons on the page, and to create and append new HTML elements for saved search buttons. These functions allow users to record their search history to easily return to a previously searched city even after the page has been closed and later repopened.

As a browser-based application, no installation is required to use this app. Nonetheless, as this application has been developed and tested using GoogleChrome, the best user experience may be featured using that browser. Other modern browsers are also supported (e.g., Safari, Firefox, Microsoft Edge), although the user experience may not be seamless. 

## Usage

Those who wish to use the application may simply follow the deployment link available above or by accessing the link available in this project's git repo. Alternatively, users may clone the repo and open the index.html file in the browser using the files cloned to their local system.

When accessing the this application through their preferred browser, users are able to search for cities and reference relevant weather information. When users perform multiple searches, past search information is saved to the dashboard for users to easily return to past searches. Search information is stored in the user's local storage until they choose to manually clear it by clicking the button provided to clear the search history.
